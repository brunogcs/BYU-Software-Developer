CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program

    (This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best
    knowledge at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the
    beginning to the end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and we
    change some of our proposed ideas. This is part of completing any
    project and is fine.  However, we still must write a proposal so
    that our teachers or supervisors know what we intend to do. Please
    answer each of the following questions to the best of your
    knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?

Library Data Analysis Tool

2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?

The program helps library administrators analyze user behavior and book circulation patterns. 
It provides insights such as the number of books per author, users with overdue books, and name-based user filtering. 
This can improve decision making regarding inventory, user management, and service optimization.

3. What will you learn from developing this program?

* How to structure a Python program using reusable functions
* Interact with a SQLite database
* Generate realistic test data using Python libraries
* Validate function behavior using automated tests with pytest.
* Improve my understanding of data analysis with pandas.

4. What Python modules will your program use?

sqlite3, pandas, random, faker, pytest, datetime

5. List the names of functions you will need?

execute_sql
insert_data_sql
consult_table_book
qtd_book_author
user_by_letter
user_suspended

6. List the names of the test functions you will write.

test_qtd_book_author()
test_user_by_letter()
test_user_suspended()
